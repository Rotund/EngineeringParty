This is my profile for my political views.  I proudly declare myself to be part of the Engineering Party (link coming).

## History
I have considered myself an independent voter and not a a democrat, though I tend to lean "left". I have looked into the libertarian mindset and am intrigued with some of the principle. Though I was raised Roman Catholic as a child, I am a mainstream protestant that has searched other religions, including agnostic and atheist, shallowly.

## Beliefs
I believe in the Constitution of the United States and the principles and processes outlined in it, including those that allow them to be modified as the environment they are used in changes. I believe the Declaration of Independence was a brilliantly written way to present civil discord. I believe most of the Founding Fathers of the US held different religious beliefs but were all members of The Enlightenment period. Therefore, they used sound scientific principles of their time, but they did not have access to the engineering practices of the modern age.

I also believe in the scientific process, especially as modified by standard engineering processes. Therefore, I also believe that evolutionary and incremental changes are preferable to more disruptive changes. That stated, I believe more disruptive changes are sometimes necessary, though they require a plan for transition. I also believe the spirit of these principles are well described by the Zen of Python (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) and those that aren't programming language specific or directly referencing Guido could help the government.

I believe the overwhelming majority of people would like to do better for themselves if given an opportunity that does not discourage them along the way. I believe that every person should have the ability to live and die with dignity.

I believe the Beatitudes and Golden Rule drive my personal life more than any other part of my religion. I believe the government should protect the weak and few from the tyranny of the strong and many in the most efficient and least intrusive way. I believe that government is a like a chain and is only as its weakest link. I believe government is a web of trust. Therefore, I also believe that every level of government should have the ability to have checks and balances against every other level.

I believe that a solution, especially a simple one, that works for one environment may not work in another environment. Therefore, I believe in the free market should be the first policy directive to any problem, but I believe that the free market is prone to corruption and tyranny. Therefore, I think that government should enforce a minimum set of standards to correct for the free market corruptions. I also believe that policies may require variables to handle different environments. I also believe that a design patterns book to help recognize the solutions for different environments are helpful.

I believe that government should encourage and protect innovation, which are principles that often end up at odds with each other as one thing builds off another. I believe this includes allowing the lower level governments the freedom to try different styles of governance but must also respect the rights of the weakest of their people and be aware of the potential corruption that could occur. I also believe that this includes encouraging small businesses to be able to rise up and provide goods and services that are wanted by their community.

I believe political correctness is important in certain scenarios. If one is trying to influence another person, this is of the utmost importance. On the other hand, I believe that political correctness does not need to maintained if used in the case of humor and those participating -- whether actively or passively -- are aware of this context. I love Cards Against Humanity, dirty and off-color humor, the correspondent's dinners, roasts, etc.

## Shortcomings
I try to keep people from different sides in my sphere of influence, but I often fail and am therefore subject to the effects of an echo chamber.

I am just as likely as everyone else to suffer selective attention bias. (See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJG698U2Mvo)

I have not read The Federalist Papers.

I tend to speak in idioms, which I realize do not translate well or may not be understood by others.

I realize that I am as hypocritical as everyone else due to my biases and request others to call me out on them.

I often still look for perfect solutions over better solutions.

## Biases
By stating these, I hope to avoid these from becoming too powerful in my own views.
I bias myself to the rights of workers over the rights of business owners.
I bias myself to the needs of those in urban areas over rural areas.
